# 🧠 Real-Time Multi-Digit Handwritten Recognition Using CNN

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a **Real-Time Multi-Digit Handwritten Recognition System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** combined with **Bidirectional LSTM** for sequence learning. The system is capable of recognizing multiple handwritten digits in a single image and works efficiently with real-time user input through a web interface.

The project is implemented using **Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Flask**, and trained on **MNIST/EMNIST datasets** to achieve high accuracy.
